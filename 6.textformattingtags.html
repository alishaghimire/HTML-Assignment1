    <p> <b>variables</b> are fundamental elements used to store data that can be manipulated throughout a program. A variable is essentially a container that holds data that can be changed during the execution of a program. Java supports various types of variables, each designed for specific data types and use cases.</p>
    <p>a keyword is a <strong> reserve word that conveys a specific meaning to the Java compiler .</strong>  Keywords are special words that have a predefined meaning to the Java compiler. They are reserved words and cannot be used as an identifier, function names, class names, etc in a programming language.</p>
    <p> <I> HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the basic scripting language used by web browsers to render pages on the World Wide Web. HyperText allows a user to click a link and be redirected to a new page referenced by that link.</I></p>
    <p> Data Structures is about how data can be stored in different structures. Algorithms is about how to solve different problems, often by searching through and manipulating data structures. <em>Theory about Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) helps us to use large amounts of data to solve problems efficiently.</em></p>
    <p>C is a general-purpose programming language.<q>It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and remains very widely used and influential.</q>  By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs.</p>
    <p><blockquote>A method in Java is a block of code that, when called, performs specific actions mentioned in it.</blockquote>For instance, if you have written instructions to draw a circle in the method, it will do that task. </p>
    <p>A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science. It mainly allows efficient <del>insertion and deletion</del> operations compared to arrays. Like arrays, it is also used to implement other data structures like stack, queue and deque. Hereâ€™s the comparison of Linked List vs Arrays</p>
